One Horoscope. Infinite Possibilities. Jake Gibson's (Cam Gigandet) horoscope forecasts a perfect FIVE STAR DAY the morning of his birthday, but what's foretold as a flawless day unfolds to be far less than stellar. Jake's world turns upside down when all that could go wrong ... does. Determined that Astrology has no legitimacy, Jake embarks on a journey to test the theory of Astrology by finding the three people born the same time and place as himself - Sarah Reynolds (Jena Malone), Yvette Montgomery (Brooklyn Sudano) and Wesley Henderson (Max Hartman). The journey quickly uproots Jake from the small college town of Berkeley, California, to downtown Chicago where he sets out to find and interview Sarah, Yvette and Wesley to see if their birthdays proved to be as deplorable as his own. Jake's pursuit in finding his three Astrological matches (or Zodiac twins) will not only test his convictions, but validate how life's unexpected twists of fate can deliver much more than the anticipated. The unforeseen takes Jake from the Windy City, to the boardwalk of New Jersey's Atlantic City, to the bustling streets of New York. What Jake learns along the way is an important lesson about life, love, fate and destiny that will unexpectedly change his life forever.","directors_names":["Danny Buday"],"actors_names":["Cam Gigandet","Derek Shipp","Guy Herbert","Will Yun Lee"],"writers_names":["Danny Buday"],"directors":[{"id":"9d39e6a1-0b39-4c73-af49-3656470a4880","name":"Danny Buday"}],"actors":[{"id":"17bf5adc-1fcd-48e6-943d-9a2c198781d4","name":"Cam Gigandet"},{"id":"3d5c4cd7-7772-4099-a6c3-c1aa06de02fc","name":"Guy Herbert"},{"id":"5509f1e0-d985-4d33-8393-502d95a355fe","name":"Derek Shipp"},{"id":"cfb997e7-9b3b-46c6-ad9d-95056b84c7fd","name":"Will Yun Lee"}],"writers":[{"id":"9d39e6a1-0b39-4c73-af49-3656470a4880","name":"Danny Buday"}]}},{"_index":"movies","_type":"_doc","_id":"2b75dccd-bfe0-4aa7-a17a-cbb1a87d8968","_score":3.6897779,"_source":{"id":"2b75dccd-bfe0-4aa7-a17a-cbb1a87d8968","imdb_rating":4.0,"genres":["Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"title":"Star Trek: New Worlds","description":"New resource-rich planets have been formed on the borders of Federation, Romulan, and Klingon space.
